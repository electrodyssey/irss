Infrared soldering station controller with a two Pt100 temperature sensors and 8 pwm outputs

Warning: this is only a working prototype and hasn't been completely tested yet (temperature readout is already working, other things are in progress).

Warning: Please disregard the i2c labels on the MCP3551 interface, it's SPI really =) I've naming it i2c by mistake.


Firmware will be available later in a different repository
